## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Start the interactive trading bot:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The bot will display a menu with the following options:

**With Private Key (Full Mode):**

3. Check Allowance
4. Set Allowance
5. Find Current Bitcoin Market
6. Get Price Data (Bid/Ask)

```bash
npm run auto-trade
```

The automated bot will:
- Connect to price feeds via WebSocket
- Monitor price differences between software predictions and Polymarket
- Execute trades when threshold is met
- Automatically place stop-loss and take-profit orders
- Monitor balances periodically

### Utility Scripts

```bash
# Check wallet balances
npm run check-balance

# Generate API credentials
npm run gen-creds

npm run allowance

# Get bid/ask prices for a token
npm run bid-ask <token_id>

# Find markets
npm run market

# Place orders (example usage)
npm run order
```

```

## Getting Started

### 1. Generate API Credentials

First, generate your Polymarket CLOB API credentials:
```bash
npm run gen-creds
```

This will create a `.credentials.json` file with your API keys.

### 2. Check Your Balance

Verify you have sufficient funds:
```bash
npm run check-balance
```

You need:
- At least $5.00 USDC for trading
- At least 0.05 MATIC for gas fees

### 3. Set Token Allowance

Before trading, approve USDC spending:
```bash
npm run allowance
```

Or use the interactive menu (option 4).

### 4. Start Trading

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Automated Mode:**
```bash
npm run auto-trade
```

## Security

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:**

1. **Never commit your `.env` file** - It contains your private key
2. **Never commit `.credentials.json`** - It contains API keys
3. **Keep your private key secure** - Anyone with access can control your wallet
4. **Use a dedicated trading wallet** - Don't use your main wallet
5. **Start with small amounts** - Test thoroughly before larger trades
6. **Review all transactions** - Verify before confirming trades

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files.

## Trading Strategy (Automated Bot)

The automated bot implements an arbitrage strategy:

1. **Price Monitoring**: Continuously monitors prices from:
   - External software WebSocket feed
   - Polymarket market data

2. **Opportunity Detection**: Detects when price difference exceeds threshold

3. **Trade Execution**:
   - Places market buy order
   - Sets take-profit order (default: +$0.01)
   - Sets stop-loss order (default: -$0.005)

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Cooldown between trades (default: 30 seconds)
   - Balance monitoring
   - Automatic reconnection on WebSocket failures

## Troubleshooting

### "Private key not provided"
- Ensure `PRIVATE_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
- Check that the private key starts with `0x`

### "Insufficient funds"
- Fund your wallet with USDC on Polygon
- Ensure you have MATIC for gas fees
- Use `npm run check-balance` to verify

### "RPC is not valid"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify `POLYGON_RPC_URL` is correct
- Try a different RPC endpoint

### WebSocket connection issues
- Check firewall settings
- Verify WebSocket URLs are correct
- The bot will automatically retry with exponential backoff

### "Allowance insufficient"
- Run `npm run allowance` to set allowance
- Or use the interactive menu (option 4)
- You can set "max" for unlimited allowance
