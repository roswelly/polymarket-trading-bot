### Start Copy Trading

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Expected Output

When running successfully, you should see:
```
Target User Wallet address is: 0x...
My Wallet address is: 0x...
API Key created/derived
Trade Monitor is running every 1 seconds
Executing Copy Trading
Waiting for new transactions...
```
### Trading Strategies

* **Buy Strategy**: When target wallet buys, calculate position size based on balance ratio
* **Sell Strategy**: When target wallet sells, match the sell proportionally
* **Merge Strategy**: When target wallet closes position but you still hold, sell your position
* **Error Handling**: Retry failed orders up to RETRY_LIMIT, then mark as failed

### Common Issues

1. **"USER_ADDRESS is not defined"**
   - Check your `.env` file exists and has all required variables

2. **"Cannot find module '@polymarket/clob-client'"**
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies

3. **"invalid hexlify value"**
   - Check `PRIVATE_KEY` is 64 hex characters without `0x` prefix

4. **"API Key creation failed"**
   - Verify `PRIVATE_KEY` matches `PROXY_WALLET`
   - Ensure wallet has proper permissions
